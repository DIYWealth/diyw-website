					        	<h3>Co-founder</h3>
					        </header>
                            <p>John studied Mathematics at the University of Warwick, followed by a master’s degree in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at the University of Oxford. He then joined Orbis Investment Management as a Performance Analyst in 2009.</p>
                            <p>In 2011 John returned to academia to pursue his interest in particle physics by studying for a master’s in Physics at Imperial College London. John subsequently joined the University of Liverpool to study for a PhD in High Energy Physics as part of the SNO+ neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment, located in an underground laboratory in a mine in Northern Ontario.</p>
                            <p>John is currently based in Vancouver, working as a postdoctoral research fellow at TRIUMF, Canada's particle accelerator centre, in conjunction with the University of Winnipeg. His field of research is neutrino oscillation physics, and is a member of the Japan-based T2K and Super-Kamiokande experiments as well as the next generation Hyper-Kamiokande proto-collaboration. These experiments involve sending underground beams of neutrinos across Japan and detecting their interactions in large tanks of water. Current interests include machine learning applications for event reconstruction.</p>
                            <p>John is a keen musician, playing saxophone and piano, although his enthusiasm is far greater than his competence. He is also attempting to learn Spanish in his free time.</p>

					        	<h2>Rob Stainforth</h2>
					        	<h3>Co-founder</h3>
					        </header>
					        <p>Rob studied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Durham, UK, specialising in particle physics phenomenology. Upon completing his Master's thesis in neutrino physics he began a PhD at the University of Liverpool, UK to further his interest in the field. The PhD programme allowed for several interesting travel opportunities, including the work experience at the SNOLAB research facility, located 2km underground in an operating Nickel mine. It was during this time Rob developed an interest in the Canadian mining sector, and by extension, its role in the global commodities market.</p>
                            <p>Rob is a keen middle distance runner, even in the Canadian winter to which he has become accustomed. He also enjoys photography and keeping up to date with global mining news.</p>
                            <p>He is currently based in Ottawa, working as a research scientist in radiation protection.</p>
