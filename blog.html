					    	<h3>Encana relocating to United States</h3>
					    	<h4>2020/01/16</h4>
					    </header>
                        <p>It was announced today that Encana Corporation (ECA) shareholders voted to redomicile in the US and to rebrand as Ovintiv. Under the restructuring Encana shareholders would exchange five common shares of Encana for each Ovintiv common stock.</p>
                        <p>This left us with a decision to make about how the DIYWealth should treat such an event. We could have exchanged the shares as agreed by Encana, but we weren't sure how the arrangement would affect Ovintiv's inclusion by the algorithm. We decided that any of our virtual portfolios holding Encana should immediately sell all shares and instead purchase the highest ranked stock not already in the portfolio.</p>

					    	<h3>Portfolio performance review</h3>
					    	<h4>2019/12/31</h4>
					    </header>
                        <p>It has been an interesting following the performance of the DIYWealth virtual portfolios. A clear trend can be seen, that the higher the minimum market capitalisation, the better the portfolio performance. This trend has been observed for the market as a whole over the better part of the last decade, and particularly this past year. It is unsurprising that this should be reflected in our portfolios.</p>
                        <p>The $50 billion and $10 billion minimum MCap portfolios are the only ones to beat the S&P 500 index since inception. The S&P 500 constituents currently have a mean MCap value of approximately $54 billion. The other virtual portfolios are likely to have a lower average MCap value. We will develop tools to demonstrate summary data of the constituents of our portfolios to better explain their performance.</p?
