                                <h3>Thinking about investing in the stock market?</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>Over the last 10 years the S&amp;P 500 (the most valuable 500 stocks on American exchanges) has gone up an average of 12.1% per year<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">&#8224;</a></sup>. That’s a healthy return. No wonder that when people think about investing, they’re usually thinking about the stock market.</p>
                            <header>
                                <h3>So what are your options as an investor?</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>The simplest way of investing in the stock market is through an equity fund. Simplistically, they fall into two categories. There are index trackers which will try to match the performance of a particular index, for example the S&amp;P 500. Index trackers have the benefit of having low fees, so less of your returns will go to the money managers, but by their nature won’t beat the market.</p>
                            <p>Managed equity funds will try to beat the market. A team of analysts will spend their days hunting down what they think are the best stock picks and trying to beat the market, but they will expect to be paid for that so they’re going to take a cut of your returns. The reality is that most fund managers don’t beat the market anyway!</p>
                            <p>Alternatively you could pick the stocks yourself. Make the right choices and you beat the market and keep all the proceeds. Deciding what to invest in can be a daunting prospect though. Let us paint a picture for you. Suppose you’ve got a hunch, maybe read a favourable news report about a company, and you’re considering investing. So you pore over the balance sheet, compare it to its competitors, and convince yourself it’s a good pick. That’s fine, it’s a perfectly valid investment strategy, it’s how a lot of the pros operate. But you’d better do that at least 10 times so you’re not overexposed to that one stock. That’s a lot of work. And now you’ve bought your portfolio what do you do next? When’s the right time to sell? Are there better prospects out there? And what happens if the price goes down? Do you stick it out our cut your losses? Investing is stressful, right? That’s what we think, anyway, and we usually make our worst decisions when we’re stressed out.</p>

                                <h3>What is DIYWealth trying to achieve?</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>When we (Rob and John) met while studying for our PhDs at Liverpool University, we bonded over our interest in the stock market, but also how inpenetrable it seemed to the uninitiated. If we felt like that, then surely other people must do too. That's the problem we're trying to solve at DIYWealth. We wanted to develop a simple investment strategy, with a clear set of rules, that any investor could follow. Among the resources we discovered on our quest was The Little Book That Beats The Market by Joel Greenblatt that inspired our approach, although we have some key differences. We’ll explain how our strategy works in a bit, but in short it tells us what companies to buy and when to sell them. That takes the emotion out of the equation.</p>
                            <header>
                                <h3>How does DIYWealth work?</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>DIYWealth follows a very simple strategy. We wanted it to be easy to understand, intuitive, and easy to follow.</p>
                            <p>We use two simple metrics, one to tell us that the stock price is currently good value, and another to tell us that the company has good profitability. We use these two metrics to rank the stocks and pick the ones that come out on top.</p>
                            <p>For value we use skock’s “price to earnings” (P/E) ratio. The lower the P/E ratio, the lower the stock price compared to the company’s earnings.</p>
                            <p>For profitability we use the companies’ “return on equity” (ROE) value. ROE is a ratio of a company’s net income to its shareholder equity. Shareholder equity is another way of saying net assets, or assets minus debt. The higher the net income compared to shareholder equity, the more profitable the company is.</p>
                            <p>All we do is divide P/E by ROE for each company and rank that metric from lowest to highest. We cut out any companies that aren’t big enough (below a market capitalization threshold) and pick the highest ranked stocks. This is our way of following the principles of “value investing” i.e. choosing stocks we believe the market hasn’t recognised the value of.</p>
                            <p>We are testing this strategy out by tracking the performance of virtual portfolios following the DIYWealth strategy. Each portfolio buys 30 or 50 stocks from the list and holds them for one year, in the hope that their value will be appreciated by the market. Any stocks that have dropped off the list after one year are sold, and replaced with the highest ranked new stocks.</p>
                            <p>Simple, right? There are no great secrets to this investment technique, just a few simple ideas. Full disclosure though, we are just tracking these virtual portfolios for now, we have not yet invested any of our own money in the strategy.</p>
                            <header>
                                <h3>Some words of caution</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>Do not invest in the stock market if you need access to your money within a 5 year time frame at an absolute minimum. Period! The market can go down as well as up and there are no guarantees about your returns. We believe that investing in the stock market is a lifetime pursuit, and certainly not for making a quick buck.</p>
                            <p>Please note that there is no perfect metric for future stock performance. If there was everyone would use it. Every company is different, and these metrics certainly have their flaws. Even if we demonstrate that the strategy has performed very well over a number of years, past performance is no guarantee of future performance.</p>
                            <p>The strategy presented here does not do a detailed analysis of any of the stock picks. That’s an added element of risk, hence why our virtual portfolios hold many stocks to diversify their assets.</p>
                            <p>We want to be very clear that we are not making any recommendations about what you should do with your own money. If you use the strategy presented here, you do so at your own risk.</p>
